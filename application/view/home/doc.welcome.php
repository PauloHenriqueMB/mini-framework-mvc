							<strong>MINI-FRAMEWORK-MVC</strong> is an extremely simple and easy to understand PHP framework based on project <a href="https://github.com/panique/mini3">MINI3</a>.
							<strong>MINI-FRAMEWORK-MVC</strong> is NOT a professional framework. As a result, it does not come with all the features and functionalities that real 
							frameworks have. It is limited to a very reduce number of helper libraries.
							<br></br>
							This project can be suitable to anybody who just wants to show some pages, make some database calls, implement sessions, validate forms, 
							and do some AJAX calls here and there, without the need of reading a lot of documentation of those more advance, complex and professional 
							frameworks. <strong>MINI-FRAMEWORK-MVC</strong> is easy to install, runs nearly everywhere and doesn't make things more complicated than necessary.
							<br></br>
							For a deeper introduction into <strong>MINI-FRAMEWORK-MVC</strong> root project <a href="https://github.com/panique/mini3">MINI3</a>, have a look into this blog post:
							<a href="http://www.dev-metal.com/mini-extremely-simple-barebone-php-application/">MINI, an extremely simple barebone PHP application</a>.
							<br></br>
							We really hope this small "framework" can be useful as <a href="https://github.com/panique/mini3">MINI3</a> has been to us. If you would like to have a look

							<strong>MINI-FRAMEWORK-MVC</strong> started as an idea and a challenge. I am not exactly a professional PHP programmer, but I had the 
							basic knowledge. However, I wanted to improve and learn in dept how a MVC framework was build. So, I bought the book <strong>Pro PHP MVC</strong> by 
							<strong>Chris Pitt</strong>, and read it during my free time. In this book, I got the chance to get to know current most popular professional MVC
							frameworks. And at the same time, the book explains how to build from scratch classes that are useful for a MVC Framework.
							<br></br>
							To complement the book, I also took the Udemy's course 
							<a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-php-model-view-controller-pattern-php-mvc/learn/v4/overview">Learn PHP Model View Controller Pattern (PHP MVC)</a>. 
							It was in this course where I understood how to join the different classes need in a framework and got to know <a href="https://github.com/panique/mini3">MINI3</a>.
							<br></br>
							After reading the book and finishing the course, I though myself it would be a good idea to combine some of the lessons learnt from both and implement 
							them in <a href="https://github.com/panique/mini3">MINI3</a>. But I did not want to build everything from scratch. And that is why, some of the libraries 
							are just implementations of already existing ones, whereas some are adaptations of snippets of code, and some others are fully developed by me.

					    	This project started as a way of helping me understand and learn about MVC design pattern. But it grew up to include some other libraries 
					    	that have been helpful to me. It might not fully follow MVC principles or not perfectly coded, but it was developed with all the good 
					    	intensions at heart. I also like what our good friend from <a href="https://github.com/panique/mini3">MINI3</a> said. So I will just quote him:
					    </p>
						<blockquote>
							<p class="text-justify">
								"... MINI is just a simple helper-tool I've created for my daily work, simply because it was much easier to setup and to
								handle than real frameworks. For daily agency work, quick prototyping and frontend-driven projects it's totally okay,
								does the job and there's absolutely no reason to discuss why it's "shit compared to Laravel", why it does not follow several 
								MVC principles or why there's no personal unpaid support or no russian translation or similar weird stuff. The trolling 
								against Open-Source-projects (and their authors) has really reached insane dimensions.
								<br></br>
								I've written this unpaid, voluntarily, in my free-time and uploaded it on GitHub to share. It's totally free, for private 
								and commercial use. If you don't like it, don't use it. If you see issues, then please write a ticket (and if you are really 
								cool: I'm very thankful for any commits!). But don't bash, don't complain, don't hate. Only bad people do so...."
